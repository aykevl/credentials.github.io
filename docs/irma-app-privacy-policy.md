The [IRMA app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.irmacard.cardemu) obtains, stores and transmits personal information about you.
This document details how we use your personal information for and how the app handles it.

## Obtaining attributes

When you are obtaining new attributes (personal information) it is possible that personal information will pass through our servers. For instance, if you enroll using an identity document, a copy of this data will pass through our servers and be checked for authenticity and integrity, after which attributes containing this data will be issued to the IRMA app, which stores it and removed from the server.
The personal data will only be stored by your IRMA app and never by our servers. We will never use this data for any other purpose than provisioning your app with attributes and never share your data with any third parties.

## Using attributes

When you authenticate, you can send your personal information (in the form of attributes) to so-called verifiers. These verifiers are possibly run by third parties.
The IRMA app will only reveal the attributes you select to verifiers, after asking for your permission.

## Stored attributes

The IRMA app is meant for testing and demo purposes only.
The security of the stored information is not guaranteed in any way.

## Additional logging

As we are currently in a testing phase with the IRMA app, we might store some information, such as device identifiers, in case of unexpected behavior.
We never collect the personal information explicitly stored by the IRMA app.
