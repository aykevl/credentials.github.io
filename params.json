It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"### Welcome to IRMA's Development & Engineering headquarters\r\nThis is the place to find out more about the code that actually drives the IRMA project.\r\n\r\nThis page has just been created and will be under development for some time. In the end it will contain a guide/manual for developers to develop new IRMA applications/services or to integrate IRMA support into existing applications and services.\r\n\r\n## Credentials API\r\nTo start we need to create a working directory (replace <workdir> with a name of your choice).\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir <workdir>\r\n$ cd <workdir>\r\n```\r\nWithin this working directory we will check out the various projects and set up the IRMA development environment. Most of the projects provide both Eclipse project files as well as Ant build files. When using the Ant build file, running the `ant` command, will produce three `.jar` files:\r\n - `<projectname>.lib.jar` or `<projectname>.app.jar`: The binaries of the library or application. Applications can be run using the `java -jar <projectname>.app.jar` command.\r\n - `<projectname>.src.jar`: The sources of the project combined into a single archive.\r\n - `<projectname>.dev.jar`: A combination of the above, which is convenient for developers.\r\n\r\n# SCUBA\r\nFor the communication with the IRMA card we use the [SCUBA library] (http://scuba.sf.net) to provide a layer of abstraction.\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/credentials/scuba.git\r\n$ cd scuba\r\n$ ant\r\n$ cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Idemix\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/credentials/idemix_library.git\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/credentials/idemix_terminal.git\r\n```\r\nThe next step is to prepare these sources. For this we first need to [download the Idemix sources](https://prime.inf.tu-dresden.de/idemix/) from IBM and store them in the idemix_library created by the clone command. These sources need to be patched, hence the additional `ant prepare` command.\r\n```\r\n$ cd idemix_library\r\n$ ant prepare; ant\r\n$ cd ../idemix_terminal\r\n$ cp ../scuba/scuba.dev.jar ../idemix_library/idemix_library.dev.jar lib\r\n$ ant\r\n$ cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\n# IRMA\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/credentials/irma_configuration.git\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/credentials/credentials_api.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd credentials_api\r\n$ ln -s ../irma_configuration\r\n$ cp ../scuba/scuba.dev.jar ../idemix_library/idemix_library.dev.jar ../idemix_terminal/idemix_terminal.dev.jar lib\r\n$ ant\r\n$ cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Ignore anything below this.)\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
